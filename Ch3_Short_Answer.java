 * 1. "Conditionally executed" refers to code that runs only if specific
 * conditions are true.
 * 
 * 2. A misplaced semicolon can cause an if statement to run incorrectly
 * by placing the semicolon after the parenthesis. This causes the conditional
 * statement of the if statement to be treated as a complete statement. The 
 * semicolon should be placed at the end of the conditionally executed block refers to code that runs only if specific

 * 3. All statements inside a set of braces should be indented to make the 
 * code easier to read as well as to identify the code as belonging to the 
 * if statement.
 * 
 * 4. When you compare two objects with the == operator, you are asking the 
 * question, "Are the memory addresses of these two strings the same?"  
 * 
 * 5. A flag variable is one that is meant to stay the same until certain 
 * conditions have become true. Flag variables should be of boolean type.
 * 
 * 6. Trailing if statements should be used to catch all extra conditions 
 * that could arise of none of the listed conditions turn out to be true.
 * 
 * 7. The && operator works by testing whether the boolean expressions on 
 * either side of the operator are true.
 * 
 * 8. The || operator works by testing whether one or more of the boolean 
 * expressions in the statement are true.
 * 
 * 9. Relational operators are called relational because they address the 
 * relationship of the values, how they relate to each other. For instance,
 * 2 is related to one by being greater than it.
 * 
 * 10. Constructors?? I'm pretty sure they aren't introduced until several 
 * more chapters, but I'd imagine they execute when a class is implemented?
